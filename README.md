### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

This is a looping zoom background that I have generated using p5js

The design that I chose is based on the screen of a Commodore 64 and early internet ASCII art. With this design I wanted to focus on generative processes of creating visuals whilst trying to get the most interesting visual out of the least amount of code possible.

### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
EXAMPLE README 

My design is inspired by fireworks and flowers. I want it to be full of changes, so that every frame can have a fresh feeling.

In terms of concrete performance, I draw different geometric figures, let them spread out, and overlay their number at the same time, through the time difference to make the whole dynamic background become enthusiastic.

In terms of color, I made different shapes correspond to different colors, and changed the parameters so that they were different every time they appeared, so that there would be differences between different loops.

In the initial design, I only added the circle. Through the color change of the circle and the superposition of the movement track, although it has a good effect, I think it is too monotonous.

In the later stages, I added a lot of geometric shapes, which made the color and pattern more variable.
